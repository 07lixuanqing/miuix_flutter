  // File-operation ownership contract:
  // - Browse and native drop share one mutation channel.
  // - At most one current generation may write controller files.
  // - Every accepted operation increments the generation before awaiting.
  // - Controller replacement revokes the previous generation immediately.
  // - Picker callback replacement also revokes the previous generation.
  // - Disabling the zone revokes work started while it was enabled.
  // - Revocation resets visual busy and drag state for the new widget contract.
  // - It does not attempt to cancel platform picker or native filesystem work.
  // - A stale success is ignored rather than applied to a newer controller.
  // - A stale validation result cannot call the newer acceptance callback.
  // - A stale rejection cannot call the newer rejection callback.
  // - A stale failure is absorbed because its initiating owner no longer exists.
  // - A current failure reaches the host callback or Flutter error reporting.
  // - Current failure cleanup always releases the busy state in `finally`.
  // - Native wrapping and picker completion follow the same generation rule.
  // - The busy guard prevents two native drops from racing each other.
  // - The busy guard also prevents browse from overlapping an active drop.
  // - Drop enter/leave visuals never grant permission to mutate file state.
  // Native-target availability contract:
  // - The native target is available only while the widget is enabled and idle.
  // - Busy is shared by picker work and native metadata wrapping.
  // - Starting either operation rebuilds the target with `enable` set to false.
  // - This prevents a second platform operation before its callbacks can fire.
  // - A callback captured from the previous build can still arrive afterward.
  // - Every native callback therefore checks current availability again.
  // - A stale enter callback cannot restore drag highlighting during picker work.
  // - A stale done callback cannot replace or append files during picker work.
  // - A rejected done callback clears any highlight left by an earlier enter.
  // - The clear is visual cleanup only and does not increment the generation.
  // - An exit callback may clear highlighting even after availability changed.
  // - Clearing an already-clear highlight is intentionally harmless.
  // - The target becomes available again only after the owning finally block.
  // - Completion callbacks observe the controller update before availability.
  // - Error callbacks observe the error before availability is restored visually.
  // - Both observations happen in one event-loop operation without a new request.
  // - Disabled widgets never emit drag-entry haptics from stale callbacks.
  // - Busy widgets likewise never emit a second drag-entry haptic.
  // - Reduced motion changes decoration timing but not target availability.
  // - Native enablement is independent from whether a picker bridge exists.
  // - Picker enablement is independent from whether native drop is supported.
  // - Both paths still share the same validation and publication transaction.
  // Operation-error ownership contract:
  // - Platform failures are distinct from validation rejections.
  // - Unsupported type, size, directory, and count remain rejection callbacks.
  // - Picker exceptions and native metadata failures use the error callback.
  // - The error callback receives the operation that produced the failure.
  // - It also receives the original object without wrapping or string conversion.
  // - The original stack trace is retained for application diagnostics.
  // - Hosts can map the operation to localized retry or explanation affordances.
  // - Hosts can present a snackbar without parsing platform exception messages.
  // - Replacing the error callback revokes work owned by the previous callback.
  // - A stale failure is not forwarded to either the old or the new callback.
  // - Disposing the widget likewise turns a late failure into a no-op.
  // - A current failure is reported exactly once for its generation.
  // - Accepted and rejected callbacks are not invoked for a failed operation.
  // - Haptic confirmation is not emitted for a failed operation.
  // - Busy cleanup remains in finally and runs even if host reporting throws.
  // - A throwing host callback remains the host's error and is not swallowed.
  // - Without a host callback FlutterError receives the original failure.
  // - FlutterError reporting includes the library and file-operation context.
  // - Default reporting avoids an unawaited Future rethrow from a tap callback.
  // - Default reporting remains visible to Flutter's normal diagnostics pipeline.
  // - Reporting never converts a failed operation into an empty successful batch.
  // - An actual empty picker result remains a successful no-change operation.
  // - Append mode keeps existing files after either kind of platform failure.
  // - Replace mode also keeps existing files because validation never began.
  // - Retry becomes available only after the failed generation releases busy.
  // - A retry receives a new generation and cannot be cleared by old cleanup.
  // - Native and browse errors follow the same lifecycle and cleanup ordering.
  // Publication ordering contract:
  // - Native metadata is fully wrapped before batch validation starts.
  // - Failure to wrap one item fails the platform operation as one batch.
  // - Partially wrapped items are never published beside an unwrapped failure.
  // - Validation still retains incoming order after wrapping succeeds.
  // - Controller mutation occurs before accepted and rejected host callbacks.
  // - Accepted callbacks receive only files committed in this operation.
  // - Rejected callbacks receive only files rejected in this operation.
  // - Each callback receives an unmodifiable snapshot of its result partition.
  // - A host mutation after callback return cannot alter those snapshots.
  // - Availability restoration occurs after all current publication callbacks.
  // - A synchronous rebuild from controller notification cannot start overlap.
  // - It sees busy true until the operation's finally block completes.
  // - A callback-triggered widget replacement increments the generation.
  // - The old finally block then cannot clear a newer operation's busy state.
  // - These ordering rules apply equally to source and HyperOS presentation.
  // - Glass, shape, and motion options never change file-operation ownership.
  // - Labels and icons may rebuild without invalidating an active operation.
  // - Validation constraints and publication callbacks always invalidate it.
  // - The explicit contract keeps visual state aligned with data ownership.
  // - Validation executes only after operation ownership is rechecked.
  // - Maximum-file accounting therefore observes one coherent controller.
  // - Append mode never combines a stale batch with a replacement controller.
  // - Replace mode never clears a new controller because an old picker returned.
  // - A widget disposal makes mounted false and blocks every completion write.
  // - External controllers remain caller-owned and are never disposed here.
  // - Private controllers retain the existing ownership behavior on replacement.
  // - Callback identity is checked at widget update, before the next build paints.
  // - The generation is monotonic only within one State lifetime, which is enough.
  // - Integer overflow is not practically reachable within a Flutter State life.
  // - File byte readers remain lazy and are not invoked during batch validation.
  // - Directory entries still bypass byte-length probing as before.
  // - MIME and extension checks remain pure and independent of operation tokens.
  // - Haptic feedback occurs only for the batch that actually commits.
  // - Tests replace both controller and picker while the first Future is pending.
  // - The stale result must leave both old and new controllers unchanged.
  // - A following fresh operation must still be enabled and commit normally.
  // - Merely resetting `_busy` would not prevent the stale `_accept` call.
  // - Merely checking mounted would not distinguish a reused State generation.
  // - Capturing the old controller would write stale data into an inactive owner.
  // - Applying to the new controller would corrupt the replacement's state.
  // - Generation comparison is therefore required at every asynchronous boundary.
  // Public configuration normalization contract:
  // - Release behavior cannot depend on constructor assertions being enabled.
  // - A non-positive file count resolves to one accepted file per collection.
  // - This fallback preserves a useful single-file picker instead of disabling it.
  // - A negative byte ceiling resolves to zero rather than becoming unlimited.
  // - An explicit zero byte ceiling remains valid for empty-file workflows.
  // - Unknown native lengths cannot be guessed and therefore remain admissible.
  // - Hosts may inspect or read those unknown-length files after acceptance.
  // - A non-finite minimum height resolves to the calibrated default height.
  // - A non-positive minimum height follows the same deterministic fallback.
  // - Layout never receives NaN, infinity, or a negative minimum constraint.
  // - Empty extension patterns carry no type information and never match.
  // - A lone period is likewise ignored rather than matching names ending in it.
  // - Extension matching trims surrounding configuration whitespace.
  // - Extension matching remains case-insensitive across desktop filesystems.
  // - MIME patterns trim whitespace before exact or wildcard comparison.
  // - Empty MIME patterns never turn a non-empty allow-list into allow-all.
  // - An entirely empty allow-list continues to mean that all types are allowed.
  // - A list containing only invalid patterns is an authored restrictive list.
  // - Therefore such a list rejects instead of silently becoming allow-all.
  // - Directory admission is evaluated before file type and byte constraints.
  // - Accepted directories may still be filtered by an authored type allow-list.
  // - Existing appended files consume the configured count before new candidates.
  // - Rejected candidates do not consume a slot needed by a later valid candidate.
  // - Input order is retained for both accepted and rejected result collections.
  // - Replace mode publishes an empty accepted list as a real controller clear.
  // - Append mode avoids notifying the controller when no file was accepted.
  // - Acceptance and rejection callbacks receive immutable result snapshots.
  // - Controller storage remains caller-readable but mutation stays controller-owned.
  // - Disabled visual state reaches the nested browse button as well as the shell.
  // - A disabled button cannot look actionable while `_browse` silently refuses it.
  // - Native DropTarget enablement mirrors the same effective enabled state.
  // - Turning native drop off invalidates a native operation already in flight.
  // - Changing only labels or decoration does not invalidate file operations.
  // - Changing validation values invalidates them before the next result commits.
  // - Changing publication callbacks also creates a new operation generation.
  // - Old callbacks are never invoked with data validated by a newer configuration.
  // - New callbacks are never invoked with data selected under an older contract.
  // - Callback identity comparison is intentional even for equivalent closures.
  // - List identity comparison assumes widget configuration lists are immutable.
  // - This follows Flutter's immutable-widget input convention for public fields.
  // - A busy indicator belongs only to the generation that currently owns work.
  // - Revocation clears that indicator without attempting platform cancellation.
  // - The next valid browse action may start immediately after configuration change.
  // - A stale `finally` block cannot clear the busy state of that newer action.
  // - Current platform errors remain observable instead of being swallowed globally.
  // - Errors from revoked owners are absorbed because no current caller owns them.
  // - Haptic confirmation remains tied to committed accepted or rejected batches.
  // - Geometry normalization changes layout safety, not filtering or callback order.
  // - These invariants apply equally to Android picker and desktop drag entry paths.
