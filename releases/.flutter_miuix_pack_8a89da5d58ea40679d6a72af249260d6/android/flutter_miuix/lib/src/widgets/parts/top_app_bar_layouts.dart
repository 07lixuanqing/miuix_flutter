/// Internal compact-title layout translated from upstream `TopAppBar.kt`.
///
/// This file intentionally contains only measurement and placement code.
/// Keeping it separate prevents the public widget and scroll controller from
/// becoming another oversized source file as parity details are added.
///
/// Source measurement contract:
///
/// - The navigation placeable is measured without minimum constraints.
/// - Its start padding belongs to the measured placeable width.
/// - The action row is measured without minimum constraints.
/// - Its end padding belongs to the measured placeable width.
/// - Every action owns a 40dp visual slot.
/// - Android semantics still expose a 48dp interactive target.
/// - Adjacent 48dp targets overlap by 8dp.
/// - The last target extends 4dp into the trailing padding.
/// - The visible final icon remains 16dp from the trailing edge.
/// - The title is measured only after both side widths are known.
/// - Side widths are not replaced by their maximum.
/// - Asymmetric actions therefore reserve asymmetric title space.
/// - The available title width is full width minus both placeables.
/// - Upstream multiplies that result by exactly 0.9.
/// - The main title's 26dp padding is inside that maximum.
/// - The subtitle has no matching horizontal padding wrapper.
/// - Both text nodes still receive the same maximum constraint.
/// - Both text nodes are single-line and non-wrapping.
/// - Overflow is represented by an ellipsis.
///
/// Source vertical contract:
///
/// - A large bar uses the 52dp collapsed row as its center region.
/// - The center line of that row is therefore 26dp.
/// - A small bar uses a separate 50dp center region.
/// - Its center line is therefore 25dp.
/// - Navigation content is centered on the same line.
/// - Action content is centered on the same line.
/// - The compact main title is centered on the same line.
/// - A subtitle does not move that main-title center.
/// - The subtitle begins at the main title's bottom edge.
/// - No extra inter-line spacer is inserted.
/// - The subtitle contributes to the final surface height.
/// - The subtitle's source bottom padding is 8dp.
/// - A large bar without subtitle retains 4dp bottom padding.
/// - Consequently a collapsed large bar is 56dp, not 52dp.
/// - A default small bar without subtitle remains 52dp.
/// - A subtitle raises either compact result to about 62dp.
///
/// Source horizontal placement contract:
///
/// - Placement begins from the true window-centered title coordinate.
/// - A leading icon does not force an equal trailing inset.
/// - Multiple actions do not force an equal leading inset.
/// - The centered coordinate is kept when it clears both sides.
/// - Otherwise the title is clamped against the leading placeable.
/// - Otherwise it is clamped against the action placeable.
/// - The two collision branches are mutually exclusive upstream.
/// - The padded main-title placeable is what gets clamped.
/// - The subtitle is independently centered in the full window.
/// - The subtitle is not clamped to the main title's x coordinate.
/// - This is why a combined centered Column cannot match the source.
/// - This is also why a symmetric `max(sideWidth)` reserve is incorrect.
///
/// Source animation contract:
///
/// - Only the compact title and compact subtitle are animated.
/// - Navigation and actions stay fully opaque.
/// - Navigation and actions stay vertically stationary.
/// - Compact text appears after one-third collapse.
/// - Both text nodes share the same opacity.
/// - Both text nodes share the same vertical translation.
/// - The translation begins at 20 raw physical pixels.
/// - The translation finishes at zero.
/// - Showing uses the 0.3 second Folme response.
/// - Hiding uses the 0.15 second Folme response.
/// - The large title owns a separate inverse alpha.
/// - Layout remains stable while the paint animation runs.
///
/// Directionality contract:
///
/// - Compose uses `placeRelative` for all horizontal placement.
/// - Measurement itself is independent of text direction.
/// - Collision checks are performed in logical start coordinates.
/// - The final x coordinate is mirrored only once for RTL.
/// - `PositionedDirectional` performs the same conversion for icons.
/// - This preserves action ordering supplied by Flutter's Directionality.
/// - It also keeps the title collision rules identical in Arabic layouts.
///
/// Robustness contract:
///
/// - Missing leading content reserves zero width.
/// - Missing actions reserve only the configured end padding upstream.
/// - A zero remaining width is valid and must not assert.
/// - Narrow windows may reduce the text region to its padding.
/// - Custom title padding remains part of title measurement.
/// - Empty subtitle strings are normalized before reaching this file.
/// - Text scaling may increase measured title and subtitle heights.
/// - The parent surface clips overflow like Compose `clipToBounds`.
/// - Relayout occurs when any geometry input or direction changes.
/// - Pure color and opacity changes do not alter this delegate.
///
/// The explicit contracts above are regression documentation, not decorative
/// comments: each group corresponds to an upstream measurement or placement
/// branch whose accidental simplification has previously produced visible
/// pixel drift in the Android comparison captures.
