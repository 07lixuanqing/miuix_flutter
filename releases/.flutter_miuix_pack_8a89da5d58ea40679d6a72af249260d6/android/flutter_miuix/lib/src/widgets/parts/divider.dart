/// Paints the source line centered in its own measured extent.
///
/// Compose's canvas preserves fractional coverage on the final physical pixel.
/// Flutter's renderer can rasterize the same short line as two opaque pixels,
/// so the painter resolves full and fractional pixel coverage explicitly.
///
/// Measurement contract:
///
/// * [thickness] remains a logical-pixel value in the public widget API.
/// * The render box retains that exact logical width or height.
/// * The value is multiplied by [devicePixelRatio] only during painting.
/// * Whole physical pixels receive the unmodified semantic line color.
/// * A remaining physical fraction is represented by color alpha.
/// * The final partial pixel is one device pixel wide before compositing.
/// * Layout never rounds 0.75dp up to a full logical pixel.
/// * Navigation therefore measures its divider independently from its row.
///
/// Compositing contract:
///
/// * The fractional pixel blends with the surface already behind the painter.
/// * Alpha scaling preserves custom translucent divider colors as well.
/// * The original alpha is multiplied rather than replaced by coverage.
/// * Antialiasing is disabled because coverage is already computed explicitly.
/// * Opaque full pixels and fractional pixels use separate draw operations.
/// * No Material divider opacity is applied to the MIUIX semantic color.
/// * Light and dark schemes therefore retain their exact upstream tokens.
///
/// Density examples:
///
/// * At 1x, 0.75dp becomes one pixel with 75 percent color coverage.
/// * At 2x, 0.75dp becomes one full pixel plus one half-covered pixel.
/// * At 2.625x, it becomes one full pixel plus 0.96875 pixel coverage.
/// * Dark #393939 consequently blends to #373737 on that final black pixel.
/// * At 3x, it becomes two full pixels plus one quarter-covered pixel.
/// * Integer-thickness products have no fractional painting operation.
///
/// Axis contract:
///
/// * Horizontal dividers consume height and paint from their top edge.
/// * Vertical dividers consume width and paint from their leading edge.
/// * Insets are applied outside the painter by the corresponding widget.
/// * RTL changes horizontal inset direction but never line coverage.
/// * A zero thickness produces no painted pixels and retains zero extent.
/// * Invalid thickness and density inputs are normalized by their owners.
///
/// This explicit model is intentionally shared by both divider directions.
/// Keeping it in one painter prevents navigation, popup, and standalone lines
/// from acquiring different raster behavior on the same physical display.
